// Tenant ID
//
// Wraps a string ID to indicate a Buildless Tenant ID as a type. The Tenant ID is also referred to as the "short name"
// of the tenant, and is typically a short string of letters, numbers, and dashes/underscores (DNS-compatible names only
// with a limit of 30-ish characters).
//
// This value is used as a sub-domain for custom build cache routing and other services, and may be enclosed on requests
// in order to explicitly indicate an active tenant.
//
// In some circumstances, tenants are also referred to as "organizations."
