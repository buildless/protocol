// ## User ID
//
// Wraps a string ID to indicate a Buildless User ID as a type. The User ID is also referred to as the "UID" in some
// contexts. It is an opaque value which does not change over the lifecycle of a single distinct user account.
//
// The User ID is used within the Buildless system to express a linkage to a user record, regardless of whether that
// user is operating within the context of a tenant account; the one notable exception to this is _managed users_, which
// _only_ reside within the context of a tenant account.
