For example, an entire\n   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will\n   have an outer location whose path refers to the \"extensions\" repeated\n   field without an index.\n - Multiple locations may have the same path.

The most\n   obvious example is the \"extend\" block again -- there may be multiple\n   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.\n - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For\n   example, the \"extendee\" of an extension declaration appears at the\n   beginning of the \"extend\" block and is shared by all extensions within\n   the block.\n - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span\n   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a \"group\" defines\n   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations\n   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.\n - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to\n   ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could\n   be recorded in the future.\n"},{"path":[4,19,2,0,4],"span":[851,2,10]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,6],"span":[851,11,19]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,1],"span":[851,20,28]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,3],"span":[851,31,32]},{"path":[4,19,3,0],"span":[852,2,935,3]},{"path":[4,19,3,0,1],"span":[852,10,18]},{"path":[4,19,3,0,2,0],"span":[876,4,44],"leadingComments":" Identifies which part of the FileDescriptorProto was defined at this\n location.\n\n Each element is a field number or an index.

There are two application features\n where this is useful:\n\n - **Open methods.** Some methods (for example, `AppInfo`) return publicly-available information, and don't need to\n   perform authorization steps. In this context, authorization may be wasteful.\n\n - **Anonymous-enabled methods.** Some methods (for example, cache access) can be opened up for public access on a\n   policy basis by authorized users. In this case, the method implementation is responsible for enforcing second-order\n   authorization state; for example, enforcing authorization state if-and-only-if the project under access demands it.\n\n ### Publishable API Keys\n\n \"Publishable\" API keys are keys which are safe to publish. These keys are typically used for non-sensitive or write-\n only operations, like telemetry submission. If the `publishable` flag is set, interceptors will allow invocations\n which specify a publishable key. By default, publishable keys are not allowed on any method.\n\n ### Authorization Behavior\n\n After enforcing the policies defined on this record, interceptors will mount resulting credential material within the\n execution context for the invocation. Implementations may then access these values via well-typed context keys. See\n the `CallMetadata` file for more information.\n\n Guarantees provided by this implementation:\n\n - **Values are well-formed.** If a value is read by the interceptor at all, it is well-formed. Downstream consumers\n   may assume that the value has been validated statically to a reasonable extent.\n\n - **Values are semantically valid.** If a value is read by the interceptor, it is used properly and in the right\n   \"place\" (the right header, context, etc). Downstream consumers need not verify the value's use semantics.\n\n - **Values are verified.** At the point a method invocation begins, all relevant authorization material has already\n   been calculated and enforced. Downstream consumers do not need to look up user or tenant records, for example, to\n   make sure they exist.\n\n ### Exhaustive settings list\n\n - `allow_anonymous`: Allow anonymous invocations (i.e. invocations with no credentials present). **Danger:** When\n   this option is set, authorization steps `MUST` be performed by the implementation, as applicable.\n\n - `allow_publishable`: Allow the use of \"publishable\" API keys. **Danger:** When this option is set, API keys may be\n   used which are intended to be published. The end-client may not be an explicitly-authorized user.\n\n - `require_token`: Require a valid end-user authorization token, or signed session, to be present on the request. In\n   this mode, `USER` authorization mode is implied.\n\n - `sensitive`: Mark the method as a \"sensitive\" operation. In this case, an additional authorization step may be\n   required; in some circumstances, this may be a \"sudo\" upgrade of a user's session, for instance, using 2FA. In API\n   circumstances, an additional secret-signed HMAC token may be required. Consult method documentation for more info.\n\n - `authorization_mode`: Governs the principal types that can invoke a given RPC method. Some methods are only able to\n   be invoked by end-users or within an org-wide circumstance. See the `AuthorizationMode` enum for more information.\n\n - `require_tenant`: Require the presence of tenant authorization information on a request, regardless of the mode of\n   the request (so, this does apply to `USER` credentials). In the case of `USER` credentials, a tenant `MAY` be\n   specified explicitly; if none is specified, the default tenant for the user is used. If no default tenant exists\n   for the user, an error is returned.\n\n - `permission`: Describes the minimum generalized permission level that is required to execute a given RPC method.\n   The end-user invoking a request must be granted a role which corresponds *at least* with this permission. This\n   concept only applies within the context of `USER`-type credentials.\n"},{"path":[4,0,1],"span":[153,8,27]},{"path":[4,0,2,0],"span":[155,2,27],"leadingComments":" Allow anonymous invocations (i.e. invocations with no credentials present).\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,0,5],"span":[155,2,6]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,1],"span":[155,7,22]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,3],"span":[155,25,26]},{"path":[4,0,2,1],"span":[158,2,29],"leadingComments":" Allow the use of \"publishable\" API keys.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,1,5],"span":[158,2,6]},{"path":[4,0,2,1,1],"span":[158,7,24]},{"path":[4,0,2,1,3],"span":[158,27,28]},{"path":[4,0,2,2],"span":[161,2,25],"leadingComments":" Require a valid end-user authorization token, or signed session, to be present on the request.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,2,5],"span":[161,2,6]},{"path":[4,0,2,2,1],"span":[161,7,20]},{"path":[4,0,2,2,3],"span":[161,23,24]},{"path":[4,0,2,3],"span":[164,2,21],"leadingComments":" Mark the method as a \"sensitive\" operation.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,3,5],"span":[164,2,6]},{"path":[4,0,2,3,1],"span":[164,7,16]},{"path":[4,0,2,3,3],"span":[164,19,20]},{"path":[4,0,2,4],"span":[167,2,29],"leadingComments":" Governs the principal types that can invoke a given RPC method.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,4,6],"span":[167,2,19]},{"path":[4,0,2,4,1],"span":[167,20,24]},{"path":[4,0,2,4,3],"span":[167,27,28]},{"path":[4,0,2,5],"span":[170,2,26],"leadingComments":" Require the presence of tenant authorization information on a request, regardless of the mode of the request.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,5,5],"span":[170,2,6]},{"path":[4,0,2,5,1],"span":[170,7,21]},{"path":[4,0,2,5,3],"span":[170,24,25]},{"path":[4,0,2,6],"span":[173,2,33],"leadingComments":" Describes the minimum generalized permission level that is required to execute a given RPC method.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,6,6],"span":[173,2,17]},{"path":[4,0,2,6,1],"span":[173,18,28]},{"path":[4,0,2,6,3],"span":[173,31,32]},{"path":[7],"span":[176,0,180,1]},{"path":[7,0],"span":[179,2,36],"leadingComments":" Authorization configuration for a given RPC method, as applicable.

That is, the\n format is \"{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z\"\n where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},\n {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional\n seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),\n are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone\n is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by\n \"Z\") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be\n able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).\n\n For example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past\n 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.\n\n In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the\n standard\n [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)\n method.

This lets any authorized user within the owning account\n scope access the data associated with the project.\n\n Projects can be made `PUBLIC`, which allows anybody to interact with the project's associated data, even without any\n credentials at all.

This means that any object which is uploaded to\n the project is visible to all users within the owning account scope, and, conversely, that all objects within the\n owning account scope are visible to the project.\n\n In this operating mode, objects which transit through a \"project\" (in the sense that they are fetched or created\n through that project), count toward analytics, reporting, and so on. Access generally follows the behaviors specified\n by the project's visibility mode and higher-level tenant policies.\n\n When a project is \"isolated,\" this behavior adjusts in different ways: propagation of writes up to the parent account\n scope can be withheld, or access can be withheld to the upper scope for reads.

Projects are the primary unit of organization within the\n remote build caching and tooling system.

The `id` is\n mainly for backend use only.\n\n ### Project Ownership\n\n Each project has a single owner, which is an account scope. This can be an organization or an individual user. The\n owner always has full access to data held by the project.\n\n ### Project Settings\n\n Each project has a set of settings which control how the project behaves. These settings are mutable, and can be\n adjusted by the owner of the project, or any user with sufficient permissions for the owning account scope (for\n example, both org owners and admins can adjust project settings for an org-owned project).\n\n Project settings structure is designed to evolve over time, subject to safe protocol evolution rules stipulated by\n Protocol Buffers. Values like the project's visibility mode are stored in the top-level settings message, while other\n settings are stored in nested messages. This allows for new settings to be added without breaking existing clients.\n\n ### Draft Objects\n\n Projects can be created using the `Draft` sub-record, which applies validation rules and property structure for a\n project which hasn't been persisted yet. After submission via the relevant API, a `Project` is returned.

It allows developers to build a single API service\n that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google\n APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),\n [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC\n Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),\n and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature\n and use it for large scale production services.\n\n `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies\n how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL\n path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the\n gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is\n typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.\n\n Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path\n template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long\n as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.\n The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to\n the URL path.\n\n Example:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n             get: \"/v1/{name=messages/*}\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message GetMessageRequest {\n       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.\n     }\n     message Message {\n       string text = 1; // The resource content.\n     }\n\n This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: \"messages/123456\")`\n\n Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template\n automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.\n For example:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n             get:\"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message GetMessageRequest {\n       message SubMessage {\n         string subfield = 1;\n       }\n       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.\n       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.\n       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.\n     }\n\n This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` |\n `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:\n \"foo\"))`\n\n Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a\n primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.\n In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL\n as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the\n message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as\n `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.\n\n For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field\n specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the\n message resource collection:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n           patch: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n           body: \"message\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message UpdateMessageRequest {\n       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL\n       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body\n     }\n\n The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the\n representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by\n protos JSON encoding:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:\n \"123456\" message { text: \"Hi!\" })`\n\n The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that\n every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the\n request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of\n the update method:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n           patch: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n           body: \"*\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message Message {\n       string message_id = 1;\n       string text = 2;\n     }\n\n\n The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:\n \"123456\" text: \"Hi!\")`\n\n Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to\n have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in\n the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when\n defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods\n which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.\n\n It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using\n the `additional_bindings` option. Example:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n           get: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n           additional_bindings {\n             get: \"/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}\"\n           }\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message GetMessageRequest {\n       string message_id = 1;\n       string user_id = 2;\n     }\n\n This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\")`\n `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: \"me\" message_id:\n \"123456\")`\n\n ## Rules for HTTP mapping\n\n 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request\n    message) are classified into three categories:\n    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.\n    - Fields referred by the [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body]. They\n    are passed via the HTTP\n      request body.\n    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the\n      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated\n      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same\n      name.\n  2. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is \"*\", there is no URL\n  query parameter, all fields\n     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.\n  3. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is omitted, there is no HTTP\n  request body, all\n     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.\n\n ### Path template syntax\n\n     Template = \"/\" Segments [ Verb ] ;\n     Segments = Segment { \"/\" Segment } ;\n     Segment  = \"*\" | \"**\" | LITERAL | Variable ;\n     Variable = \"{\" FieldPath [ \"=\" Segments ] \"}\" ;\n     FieldPath = IDENT { \".\" IDENT } ;\n     Verb     = \":\" LITERAL ;\n\n The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches\n zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path\n except the `Verb`.\n\n The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its\n template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable\n matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`\n is equivalent to `{var=*}`.\n\n The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`\n contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded\n before the matching.\n\n If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `\"{var}\"` or\n `\"{var=*}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client\n side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The\n server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the\n [Discovery\n Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as\n `{var}`.\n\n If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `\"{var=foo/*}\"`\n or `\"{var=**}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the\n client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.\n The server side does the reverse decoding, except \"%2F\" and \"%2f\" are left\n unchanged. Such variables show up in the\n [Discovery\n Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as\n `{+var}`.\n\n ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration\n\n gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language\n for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The\n service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`\n proto message.\n\n As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC\n transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a\n `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same\n effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you\n have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding\n specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding\n configuration in the proto.\n\n Example:\n\n     http:\n       rules:\n         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.\n         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage\n           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}\n\n ## Special notes\n\n When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the\n proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3\n specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).\n\n While the single segment variable follows the semantics of\n [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String\n Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section\n 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion\n does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead\n to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding\n for multi segment variables.\n\n The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,\n because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.\n\n The path variables **must not** capture the leading \"/\" character. The reason\n is that the most common use case \"{var}\" does not capture the leading \"/\"\n character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.\n\n Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because\n no client library can support such complicated mapping.\n\n If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map\n the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC\n Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.\n"},{"path":[4,1,1],"span":[315,8,16]},{"path":[4,1,2,0],"span":[320,2,22],"leadingComments":" Selects a method to which this rule applies.\n\n Refer to [selector][google.api.DocumentationRule.selector] for syntax\n details.\n"},{"path":[4,1,2,0,5],"span":[320,2,8]},{"path":[4,1,2,0,1],"span":[320,9,17]},{"path":[4,1,2,0,3],"span":[320,20,21]},{"path":[4,1,8,0],"span":[325,2,347,3],"leadingComments":" Determines the URL pattern is matched by this rules.

All traits that are affected by the location MUST be applicable to a location of `header` (for example, `style`).\n"},{"path":[4,18,1],"span":[176,8,14]},{"path":[4,18,2,0],"span":[177,2,25]},{"path":[4,18,2,0,5],"span":[177,2,8]},{"path":[4,18,2,0,1],"span":[177,9,20]},{"path":[4,18,2,0,3],"span":[177,23,24]},{"path":[4,18,2,1],"span":[178,2,20]},{"path":[4,18,2,1,5],"span":[178,2,6]},{"path":[4,18,2,1,1],"span":[178,7,15]},{"path":[4,18,2,1,3],"span":[178,18,19]},{"path":[4,18,2,2],"span":[179,2,22]},{"path":[4,18,2,2,5],"span":[179,2,6]},{"path":[4,18,2,2,1],"span":[179,7,17]},{"path":[4,18,2,2,3],"span":[179,20,21]},{"path":[4,18,2,3],"span":[180,2,29]},{"path":[4,18,2,3,5],"span":[180,2,6]},{"path":[4,18,2,3,1],"span":[180,7,24]},{"path":[4,18,2,3,3],"span":[180,27,28]},{"path":[4,18,2,4],"span":[181,2,19]},{"path":[4,18,2,4,5],"span":[181,2,8]},{"path":[4,18,2,4,1],"span":[181,9,14]},{"path":[4,18,2,4,3],"span":[181,17,18]},{"path":[4,18,2,5],"span":[182,2,19]},{"path":[4,18,2,5,5],"span":[182,2,6]},{"path":[4,18,2,5,1],"span":[182,7,14]},{"path":[4,18,2,5,3],"span":[182,17,18]},{"path":[4,18,2,6],"span":[183,2,26]},{"path":[4,18,2,6,5],"span":[183,2,6]},{"path":[4,18,2,6,1],"span":[183,7,21]},{"path":[4,18,2,6,3],"span":[183,24,25]},{"path":[4,18,2,7],"span":[184,2,31]},{"path":[4,18,2,7,6],"span":[184,2,19]},{"path":[4,18,2,7,1],"span":[184,20,26]},{"path":[4,18,2,7,3],"span":[184,29,30]},{"path":[4,18,2,8],"span":[185,2,18]},{"path":[4,18,2,8,6],"span":[185,2,5]},{"path":[4,18,2,8,1],"span":[185,6,13]},{"path":[4,18,2,8,3],"span":[185,16,17]},{"path":[4,18,2,9],"span":[186,2,37]},{"path":[4,18,2,9,6],"span":[186,2,22]},{"path":[4,18,2,9,1],"span":[186,23,31]},{"path":[4,18,2,9,3],"span":[186,34,36]},{"path":[4,18,2,10],"span":[187,2,26]},{"path":[4,18,2,10,6],"span":[187,2,12]},{"path":[4,18,2,10,1],"span":[187,13,20]},{"path":[4,18,2,10,3],"span":[187,23,25]},{"path":[4,18,2,11],"span":[188,2,49]},{"path":[4,18,2,11,4],"span":[188,2,10]},{"path":[4,18,2,11,6],"span":[188,11,19]},{"path":[4,18,2,11,1],"span":[188,20,43]},{"path":[4,18,2,11,3],"span":[188,46,48]},{"path":[4,19],"span":[191,0,196,1]},{"path":[4,19,1],"span":[191,8,25]},{"path":[4,19,8,0],"span":[192,2,195,3]},{"path":[4,19,8,0,1],"span":[192,8,13]},{"path":[4,19,2,0],"span":[193,4,22]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,6],"span":[193,4,10]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,1],"span":[193,11,17]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,3],"span":[193,20,21]},{"path":[4,19,2,1],"span":[194,4,28]},{"path":[4,19,2,1,6],"span":[194,4,13]},{"path":[4,19,2,1,1],"span":[194,14,23]},{"path":[4,19,2,1,3],"span":[194,26,27]},{"path":[4,20],"span":[198,0,200,1]},{"path":[4,20,1],"span":[198,8,27]},{"path":[4,20,2,0],"span":[199,2,60]},{"path":[4,20,2,0,4],"span":[199,2,10]},{"path":[4,20,2,0,6],"span":[199,11,33]},{"path":[4,20,2,0,1],"span":[199,34,55]},{"path":[4,20,2,0,3],"span":[199,58,59]},{"path":[4,21],"span":[203,0,212,1],"leadingComments":" The object provides metadata about the API.

The Buildless API is exposed as a gRPC service, a JSON-REST service,\n and as raw endpoints for use with primitive caching clients.\n\n For information about authentication and available API endpoints, see the `Buildless` service below.\n\n ## Authentication\n\n Nearly all methods on the Buildless service require authorization. There are multiple ways to authorize a request to\n the Buildless API: you can use an OIDC token acquired via an account login flow, or an API key acquired via the\n Buildless UI or CLI.\n\n When using a JWT acquired via OIDC, the token should be placed as a `Bearer`-scheme `Authorization` header in the\n request. The same is true for gRPC, except it is present in request metadata. When using an API key to authorize a\n request, it should be placed in the same `Authorization` header, also with a `Bearer` scheme. For compatibility\n reasons, the API key may also be placed in the `X-API-Key` header (with no prefix).\n\n To summarize, the API key may be specified via:\n - An `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` header\n - The `X-API-Key` header (no prefix)\n - Via HTTP Basic Authentication, with `\"apikey\"` as the username, and the API key as the password\n\n ### HTTP Basic Authentication\n\n API keys may also be specified via HTTP Basic Authentication. In this case, use the static string `apikey` as the\n username, and your API key as the password.\n\n ### Publishable Authentication\n\n The _Telemetry Service_ supports _publishable API keys_, which are keys that are used to identify a client, and are\n safe to publish publicly. Publishable keys only offer write support to the telemetry service, and do not grant any\n other access to a given Buildless tenant or user account.\n\n ## API Dispatch\n\n The Buildless service may be dispatched over gRPC, OpenAPI (via JSON/REST), or via simple HTTP GET/PUT endpoints\n which are designed to work with existing tools. The OpenAPI and HTTP endpoints are automatically generated from the\n same code, so which API you use is entirely up to you.\n\n ## API Versioning\n\n Each API version is defined in a separate gRPC interface, and made available at a dedicated URL. The most recent API\n version is served at the version name `latest`, and also at URLs with no version specified. The Buildless API is\n aggressively backwards-and-forwards compatible, and there are several ways to specify a version.\n\n ### Specifying an API version\n\n The API version can be selected via any of the following mechanisms:\n - HTTP URL path: A version may be specified in the URL path, as the first component (i.e. `/v1/...`).\n - gRPC service path: All gRPC service paths are versioned.\n - HTTP header: A version may be specified in the `Accept-Version` header (i.e. `Accept-Version: v1`). In this case,\n   requests should be sent to URLs with no version component present.\n\n ## Services: Caching\n\n Defines the API surface for the _Cache_ service, which provides build caching functionality. Methods defined in this\n service are either dispatched from API clients, or used directly from build tools, in which case dispatch frequently\n happens over HTTPS. Dispatch from internal clients typically happens from gRPC.\n\n ### Generic Endpoints\n\n The cache service provides two endpoints, `CacheGenericFetch` and `CacheGenericStore`, which are designed for use by\n generic tooling, including tools like CCache, Gradle, and others. The generic cache endpoints may be invoked over\n HTTPS or gRPC, and must be authorized either with an API key or user token.\n\n The typical case for generic endpoint use is an API key expressed in an HTTP Basic auth scheme, with the username\n `apikey` and the API key as the password.\n\n ### Specialized Endpoints\n\n The cache service may provide additional endpoints which are dedicated for specific tools. At this time, no such\n endpoints are specified.\n"},{"path":[3,0],"span":[90,0,32]},{"path":[3,1],"span":[91,0,34]},{"path":[3,2],"span":[92,0,39]},{"path":[3,3],"span":[93,0,41]},{"path":[3,4],"span":[94,0,41]},{"path":[3,5],"span":[95,0,33]},{"path":[3,6],"span":[96,0,38]},{"path":[3,7],"span":[97,0,33]},{"path":[3,8],"span":[98,0,41]},{"path":[3,9],"span":[99,0,35]},{"path":[3,10],"span":[100,0,37]},{"path":[3,11],"span":[101,0,41]},{"path":[3,12],"span":[102,0,37]},{"path":[3,13],"span":[103,0,33]},{"path":[8],"span":[105,0,31]},{"path":[8,31],"span":[105,0,31]},{"path":[8],"span":[106,0,81]},{"path":[8,11],"span":[106,0,81]},{"path":[8],"span":[107,0,34]},{"path":[8,10],"span":[107,0,34]},{"path":[8],"span":[108,0,59]},{"path":[8,1],"span":[108,0,59]},{"path":[8],"span":[109,0,37]},{"path":[8,27],"span":[109,0,37]},{"path":[8],"span":[110,0,28]},{"path":[8,9],"span":[110,0,28]},{"path":[8],"span":[111,0,116,2]},{"path":[8,1143],"span":[111,0,116,2]},{"path":[6,0],"span":[121,0,461,1],"leadingComments":" Defines the API surface for the main Buildless service.

For example, if the mask in the previous\n example is applied to a response message as follows:\n\n     f {\n       a : 22\n       b {\n         d : 1\n         x : 2\n       }\n       y : 13\n     }\n     z: 8\n\n The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z\n (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text\n output):\n\n\n     f {\n       a : 22\n       b {\n         d : 1\n       }\n     }\n\n A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a\n paths string.\n\n If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the\n operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields\n had been specified).\n\n Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the\n top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the\n field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST\n list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message\n in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,\n other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be\n clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In\n any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required\n behavior for APIs.\n\n # Field Masks in Update Operations\n\n A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the\n targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required\n to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask\n and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to\n describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all\n fields not covered by the mask.\n\n If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will\n be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that\n a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.\n\n If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an\n update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message\n in the target resource.\n\n For example, given the target message:\n\n     f {\n       b {\n         d: 1\n         x: 2\n       }\n       c: [1]\n     }\n\n And an update message:\n\n     f {\n       b {\n         d: 10\n       }\n       c: [2]\n     }\n\n then if the field mask is:\n\n  paths: [\"f.b\", \"f.c\"]\n\n then the result will be:\n\n     f {\n       b {\n         d: 10\n         x: 2\n       }\n       c: [1, 2]\n     }\n\n An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for\n repeated and message fields.\n\n In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must\n be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.\n Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default\n instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do\n not provide a mask as described below.\n\n If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to\n all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).\n Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that\n fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into\n the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted\n behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify\n a field mask, producing an error if not.\n\n As with get operations, the location of the resource which\n describes the updated values in the request message depends on the\n operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is\n required to be honored by the API.\n\n ## Considerations for HTTP REST\n\n The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must\n be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics\n (PUT must only be used for full updates).\n\n # JSON Encoding of Field Masks\n\n In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are\n separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted\n to/from lower-camel naming conventions.\n\n As an example, consider the following message declarations:\n\n     message Profile {\n       User user = 1;\n       Photo photo = 2;\n     }\n     message User {\n       string display_name = 1;\n       string address = 2;\n     }\n\n In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:\n\n     mask {\n       paths: \"user.display_name\"\n       paths: \"photo\"\n     }\n\n In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:\n\n     {\n       mask: \"user.displayName,photo\"\n     }\n\n # Field Masks and Oneof Fields\n\n Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the\n following message:\n\n     message SampleMessage {\n       oneof test_oneof {\n         string name = 4;\n         SubMessage sub_message = 9;\n       }\n     }\n\n The field mask can be:\n\n     mask {\n       paths: \"name\"\n     }\n\n Or:\n\n     mask {\n       paths: \"sub_message\"\n     }\n\n Note that oneof type names (\"test_oneof\" in this case) cannot be used in\n paths.\n\n ## Field Mask Verification\n\n The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the\n request should verify the included field paths, and return an\n `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.\n"},{"path":[4,0,1],"span":[241,8,17]},{"path":[4,0,2,0],"span":[243,2,28],"leadingComments":" The set of field mask paths.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,0,4],"span":[243,2,10]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,5],"span":[243,11,17]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,1],"span":[243,18,23]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,3],"span":[243,26,27]}]},"syntax":"proto3","bufExtension":{"isImport":true,"isSyntaxUnspecified":false}},{"name":"buildless/service/v1/query.proto","package":"buildless.service.v1","dependency":["buildless/service/v1/expr.proto","google/protobuf/field_mask.proto","google/protobuf/struct.proto"],"messageType":[{"name":"QueryOptions","field":[{"name":"page","number":1,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.QueryOptions.Pagination","jsonName":"page"},{"name":"sort","number":2,"label":"LABEL_REPEATED","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.QueryOptions.Sort","jsonName":"sort"},{"name":"filter","number":3,"label":"LABEL_REPEATED","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.QueryOptions.Filter","jsonName":"filter"},{"name":"out","number":4,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.QueryOptions.Output","jsonName":"out"}],"nestedType":[{"name":"Sort","field":[{"name":"direction","number":1,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_ENUM","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.QueryOptions.Sort.Direction","jsonName":"direction"},{"name":"field","number":2,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_STRING","jsonName":"field"}],"enumType":[{"name":"Direction","value":[{"name":"DIRECTION_DEFAULT","number":0},{"name":"ASC","number":1},{"name":"DESC","number":2}]}]},{"name":"Filter","field":[{"name":"expr","number":1,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.Expression","oneofIndex":0,"jsonName":"expr"},{"name":"prop","number":2,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.QueryOptions.Filter.PropertyFilter","oneofIndex":0,"jsonName":"prop"}],"nestedType":[{"name":"PropertyFilter","field":[{"name":"property","number":1,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_STRING","jsonName":"property"},{"name":"operator","number":2,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_ENUM","typeName":".buildless.service.v1.QueryOptions.Filter.Operator","jsonName":"operator"},{"name":"value","number":3,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".google.protobuf.Value","jsonName":"value"}]}],"enumType":[{"name":"Operator","value":[{"name":"OPERATOR_DEFAULT","number":0},{"name":"EQ","number":2},{"name":"NEQ","number":3},{"name":"LT","number":4},{"name":"LTE","number":5},{"name":"GT","number":6},{"name":"GTE","number":7},{"name":"IN","number":8},{"name":"NIN","number":9},{"name":"EMPTY","number":10},{"name":"NOT_EMPTY","number":11}]}],"oneofDecl":[{"name":"spec"}]},{"name":"Pagination","field":[{"name":"limit","number":1,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_UINT32","jsonName":"limit"},{"name":"page","number":2,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_UINT32","jsonName":"page"},{"name":"offset","number":3,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_UINT32","jsonName":"offset"}]},{"name":"Output","field":[{"name":"keys_only","number":1,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_BOOL","jsonName":"keysOnly"},{"name":"count","number":2,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_BOOL","jsonName":"count"},{"name":"mask","number":3,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".google.protobuf.FieldMask","jsonName":"mask"},{"name":"hydrate","number":4,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_MESSAGE","typeName":".google.protobuf.FieldMask","jsonName":"hydrate"}]}]}],"options":{"javaPackage":"cloud.elide.cache.proto.service.v1","javaMultipleFiles":true,"javaStringCheckUtf8":true,"optimizeFor":"SPEED","goPackage":"github.com/elide-dev/buildless/service/v1;buildless_svc_v1","ccEnableArenas":true},"sourceCodeInfo":{"location":[{"span":[11,0,156,1]},{"path":[12],"span":[11,0,18],"leadingDetachedComments":[" Copyright 2023 Elide Ventures LLC\n\n Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with\n the License.

Projects\n are an isolation mechanism and unit of organization within Buildless' data hierarchy.\n\n Projects are always owned by only one \"account scope\" (an individual user or org), and can optionally isolate data or\n share data with the main cache for the account.\n\n ## Project Visibility\n\n Projects support several \"visibility\" modes, which govern the default level of access granted to users of the cached\n data held in the project. The visibility mode is set at project creation time, and can be changed later by the owner\n or any authorized user.\n\n Projects can be one of the following visibility modes:\n - `PRIVATE`: Only the owner of the project can access the data held within it.
